DevOps is all about working with developers to deploy their software. Being a DevOps engineer requires a good 
understanding of I.T. tools and scripting languages. Not only that, it also means being an agreeable person who 
can collaborate with others to reach a common goal.

All this is to help automate the process of releasing well-documented bugless programs.

Some skills required by DevOps engineers:
Bash scripting
Powershell
Github & other version control tools
Docker
CIs like Jenkins or Travis
Python & other programming languages
Cloud computing
and the list goes on...
